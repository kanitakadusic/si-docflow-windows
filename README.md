> document processing system

This repository contains the Windows application for a document processing system. It allows users to upload and process documents via OCR, review and correct extracted data, and submit the final version. The app automatically monitors a folder for new documents, sends them to a processing server, and handles user verification and corrections. This repo focuses on the desktop application, which interacts with separate repositories for the [processing server](https://github.com/kanitakadusic/si-docflow-server.git) and [admin dashboard](https://github.com/HarisMalisevic/si-docflow-admin.git).
